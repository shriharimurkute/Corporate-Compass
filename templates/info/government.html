        <strong>In India, governance operates at multiple levels:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Central Government:</strong> Responsible for national issues like defense, foreign affairs, railways, national highways, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>State Government:</strong> Handles state-level subjects like law and order, public health, agriculture, state roads, education (concurrently), etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Government (Urban and Rural):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Urban Local Bodies (ULBs):</strong> Municipal Corporations (for large cities), Municipal Councils (for smaller cities/towns), Nagar Panchayats (for transitional areas). These are primarily the focus of Corporate Compass.</li>
                    <li><strong>Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs):</strong> For rural areas (Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis, Zilla Parishads).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Corporate Compass primarily deals with issues falling under the purview of Urban Local Bodies (Municipal Corporations/Councils).</p>
